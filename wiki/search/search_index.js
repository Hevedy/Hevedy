Go to the folder of your project \"MyProject\" and drop there the folder \"Plugins/\" from the zip file, you can close now the zip.  </p> <p>D.) Once inside the project if your project isn't a C++ one then you need to convert it. (If you don't have a .sln file in your folder or Source folder then isn't a C++ project).  To convert the project you have to follow this instructions using the Class Wizard is the best and faster way if you are new. Make sure you create an empty class, the name isn't a problem do whatever you want, it will create an empty class used by the engine to setup the whole project.  </p> <p>E.) Now go to your project root at the *.uproject file as in the image (note you will have those files with the name of your project):  right click, (in windows 11 show extra options) and then select \"Generate Visual Studio project files\" as in the image: </p> <p>F.) Double click in the *.sln project file you will see as in the prior image with the name of your project. Once it open you have to go to the top of the window of Visual Studio and select the project settings: \"Development Editor - Win64 - YourProjectName\", as in the image at the bottom, then you have to go to the right and search for your project name in the \"Solution Explorer\" window as in the image in the bottom and then right click and select \"Build\".   If you did the step correctly then you should have the last result from the image, that means you can close Visual Studio now and reopen your .uproject.  </p> <p>G.) Close Visual Studio now and reopen your .uproject, go to the plugins browser inside browse for \"Purpleprint\" you should have it listed at the left as Category, then enable the Placer one, close the project.
